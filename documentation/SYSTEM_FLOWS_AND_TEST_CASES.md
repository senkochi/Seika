# Seika System Flows and Testing Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the core business flows, event-driven integrations, error handling, edge cases, and expected behaviors across the Seika microservices learning ecosystem. It serves as an authoritative reference for QA engineers, developers, and testers during the verification and testing phases.

---

## 1. System Architecture & Service Topology

Seika is built as a microservices architecture utilizing Spring Cloud Gateway for API routing, Netflix Eureka for service discovery, RabbitMQ for asynchronous event choreography, and independent databases for service isolation.

## 2. Core Business Flows & Integration Choreography

### Flow 1: User Registration & Onboarding
This flow ensures a synchronized user record across identity, profile, and wallet services.

1. **Client Registration Request**: Client POSTs `RegisterRequest` to `/api/auth/register`.
2. **Identity Creation & Validation**: `identity-service` validates that the username is unique and the requested role is either `STUDENT` or `TEACHER`.
3. **Synchronous Profile Setup (Saga Step 1)**: `identity-service` calls `profile-service` via OpenFeign `ProfileClient.createProfile()`.
   - **Rollback Hook**: If profile creation fails (e.g. database down, timeout), `identity-service` rolls back user registration transaction and returns an HTTP `500` error.
4. **Token Generation**: Identity Service generates JWT access and refresh tokens.
5. **Asynchronous Wallet Setup (Saga Step 2)**: `identity-service` publishes `user.registered` event to the `identity.events` exchange.
6. **Wallet Initialization**: `wallet-service` consumes `user.registered`, parses user roles, and provisions a wallet:
   - **Initial Balance**: Students receive **500 coins** (configurable via config key `STUDENT_INITIAL_COINS`). Teachers receive **0 coins** (configurable via `TEACHER_INITIAL_COINS`).

---

### Flow 2: Content Creation, Submission & Moderation
This flow controls how learning resources (Flashcards & Quizzes) are published to the public marketplace.

1. **Draft Creation**: A Teacher creates a flashcard deck (`CardSet`) or a `Quiz` via their content manager interface. The initial status is saved locally in draft state.
2. **Price Range Validation**:
   - For flashcards, `flashcard-service` calls `wallet-service` configuration endpoint to fetch `MIN_PRODUCT_PRICE` (default: 10 coins) and `MAX_PRODUCT_PRICE` (default: 100,000 coins).
   - If the price is $> 0$ and outside this range, creation throws an `IllegalArgumentException` (e.g., `"Giá sản phẩm phải nằm trong khoảng từ 10 đến 100000 coin!"`).
3. **Submission Event**: Creating/modifying the content publishes a creation event (`flashcard.set.created` or `quiz.set.created`) to the `content.events` exchange.
4. **Marketplace Mirroring**: `marketplace-service` consumes this event and creates a corresponding `Product` record with `active = false` and `status = PENDING_REVIEW`.
5. **Admin Moderation**:
   - Admin views the moderation queue via `/api/marketplace/admin/products/pending`.
   - **Approve**: POSTing to `/api/marketplace/admin/products/{productId}/approve` changes product status to `PUBLISHED` and `active = true`. A reviewed event is published to notify the teacher. The item is now visible to all students in the marketplace.
   - **Reject**: POSTing to `/api/marketplace/admin/products/{productId}/reject` changes status to `REJECTED`, `active = false`, and attaches a `rejectionReason`. A reviewed event notifies the teacher.

### Flow 3: Marketplace Purchase Saga (Choreographed Transactions)
To maintain database consistency without local constraints, a distributed Saga pattern is choreographed using RabbitMQ.

    else Insufficient Balance / Error
        Wallet->>MsgBroker: Publish: wallet.debit.failed
    end

    MsgBroker->>Marketplace: Deliver event to WALLET_EVENTS_QUEUE
    Note over Marketplace: Inbox Event Validation (Idempotency check)

    alt Debit Succeeded
        Marketplace->>Marketplace: Update Order Status to PAID<br/>Create UserInventory record
        Marketplace->>MsgBroker: Publish: content.purchased (Teacher Earnings)
        MsgBroker->>Wallet: Deliver content.purchased to MARKETPLACE_EVENTS_QUEUE
        Wallet->>Wallet: Deposit price to Teacher wallet<br/>Save Transaction (REWARD)
        MsgBroker->>Profile: Deliver content.purchased to PROFILE_PURCHASE_QUEUE
        Profile->>Profile: Increment teacher's totalStudentsReached
        MsgBroker->>Notification: Deliver content.purchased to notify student & teacher
    else Debit Failed
        Marketplace->>Marketplace: Update Order Status to FAILED
        Marketplace->>MsgBroker: Notify user of transaction failure
    end
```

### Flow 4: Study, Progress Tracking & Rewards
This flow rewards students with coins, experience points (EXP), and level-ups upon completing educational content.

1. **Session Completion**:
   - **Flashcards**: When progress reaches 100% on a deck, `flashcard-service` records a `StudySession` (`completed = true`) and publishes a `deck.completed` event to `learning.events` exchange.
   - **Quizzes**: When a student submits quiz answers, `quiz-service` calculates the score (number of correct answers / total questions * 100). If the score $\ge 80.0\%$, the attempt is marked as `passed = true` and `quiz-service` publishes a `quiz.completed` event to `learning.events` exchange.
2. **Reward Processing & Rules**:
   - `reward-service` consumes the completion events.
   - **Flashcard Cooldown**: Checked using `LearningRewardLog`. If the user has already received a reward for this deck, they can only receive a new reward if the cooldown period has passed (configured via `reward.flashcard.cooldown-days`, default: `lastRewardAt.plusDays(cooldown)`).
   - **Quiz Duplication Limit**: A student is only rewarded for their **first-time pass** on a quiz set. Subsequent passing attempts are recorded but do not trigger rewards.
   - **Event Outbox**: If eligible, a `RewardGrantedEvent` is saved to the outbox and published to the message broker.
3. **Downstream Rewards Application**:
   - **Wallet Service**: Receives `RewardGrantedEvent` and deposits reward coins (type: `REWARD`).
   - **Profile Service**: Receives `RewardGrantedEvent` and increments profile EXP.
     - **Level Up Calculation**: Simple leveling logic: $\text{Level} = \lfloor \text{EXP} / 100 \rfloor + 1$. If the new level is higher than the current level, the profile updates and logs a level up.
   - **Notification Service**: Receives `RewardGrantedEvent` and pushes a system notification to the student about coins and EXP earned.

### Flow 5: Financial Operations (Top Up & Cash Out)
Manual wallet transactions are governed by strict conversion rates and validation constraints.

## 4. Interactive Frontend Verification Checklist

Verify that the React frontend client at `src/web-app` matches the expected user experience and correctly integrates with backend logic.

### 4.1 Quiz Interactive Elements
*   **Multiple Choice Quiz (MCQ)**:
    *   Selecting an option updates the component state.
    *   Submitting highlights the chosen option (Green for correct, Red for incorrect with the correct answer highlighted in Green).
*   **Fill in the Blank Quiz (FIB)**:
    *   The question text must replace underscores (`_`) with an input box.
    *   Other sequence marks must be formatted as static line placeholders.
    *   Correctness verification must trim user input and perform a case-insensitive check against the accepted answers list.
*   **Reorder Quiz**:
    *   Initial state must shuffle the elements. The component includes a safe loop to ensure the shuffled order is not identical to the correct order.
    *   Users can click on items to swap positions or use Up/Down keys to reorder.
    *   Upon submission, correct items in the correct index position are colored Green, and incorrect items are colored Red.
*   **General Grading Rule**:
    *   Students must score $\ge 80\%$ of correct items to pass the quiz and qualify for coin/EXP rewards.

### 4.2 Dashboard Auth Gating & Layouts
*   **Routing Authorization**:
    *   A guest entering `/student/dashboard` or `/teacher/dashboard` is redirected to `/auth/login`.
    *   Redirection maps old layout `/dashboard` to `/student/dashboard` for backward compatibility.
*   **Student Layout**:
    *   Available sub-routes: `learning` (Learning Hub), `flashcard/:id` (Flashcard Study), `quiz/:id` (Quiz Taking), `marketplace` (Buying products), `wallet` (Coin top up / history), and `profile` (Student profile settings).
*   **Teacher Layout**:
    *   Available sub-routes: `content` (Content manager to create quizzes and decks), `wallet` (Cash out earnings), `statistics` (Revenue dashboards, top sold items, student reached list), and `profile`.
*   **Admin Layout**:
    *   Available sub-routes: `users` (User manager), `moderation` (Moderation queue to approve/reject draft content), `config` (Configure initial balances, top-up rates, withdrawal rates, and price thresholds), and `revenue` (System revenue summary).
